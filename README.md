## 📦 Installation

### **Option 1: Run the Python code (Requires Python 3.8+)**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/queserasera29/bioseq-analyzer-pro.git
   cd bioseq-analyzer-pro
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
python bioseq_analyzer_pro.py
Option 2: Run the Standalone EXE (No Python needed)
Download the latest .exe from the Releases page
(or from this Google Drive link).

Double-click the file to launch the program.

No installation required.

🖥️ How to Use
Enter your DNA/RNA/Protein sequence in the input box.

Choose the operation you want from the menu:

Transcription

Translation

Reverse Complement

GC Content

Molecular Weight

View the results instantly in the output area.

Save results if needed by clicking "Save".

📊 Example
Input DNA Sequence:

nginx
Copy
Edit
ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGTAA
Operations & Results:

Operation	Result
Transcription	AUGCGUACGUAGCUAGUAA
Translation	M R T * L V *
Reverse Complement	TTTAACTAGCTACGTACGC

📌 Notes for Students
Works with FASTA sequences (remove headers before pasting).

Ensure sequences only contain valid bases:

DNA: A, T, G, C

RNA: A, U, G, C

Protein sequences should be single-letter amino acid codes.
